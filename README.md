The Equitable Syllabus Project at NYU‚Äôs ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program) department provides resources to help faculty create inclusive and equitable syllabi. These resources include research service, syllabus guide, syllabus workshop, and curated database of resources representing minority groups.

However, the lack of centralized access point for these resources made them difficult to utilize. Additionally, the database was on Google sheets, which made it difficult for faculty to find the information they needed. To solve this problem, I designed the Equitable Syllabus Project website to help professors take advantage of these tools and create a syllabus that can foster a more inclusive learning environment.
